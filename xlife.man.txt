\bNAME

\g Xlife - Conway's Game of Life and other
 cellular automata for Commodore +4.

\bDESCRIPTION

\g The program helps the  user  play  with
 John Horton Conway's 'Life' game.

\bCOMMANDS

 \x!  Place random cells on  the  area  of
    the universe on the screen.
 \x%  Set a percentage density for a  ran-
    domly filled area.  Default  is 59%.
 \x+  Zoom the view in.
 \x-  Zoom the view out. 
 \x.  Place cursor to the center  of  uni-
    verse.
 \x?  Help for xlife.
 \x@  Toggle disk drive unit # at the load
    menu.
 \xB  Benchmark. Enter number  of  genera-
    tions and get time. This is also the
    fastest  mode of the evolution.
 \xC  Clear the universe.
 \xE  Toggle pseudocolor display mode.  In
    this mode, the new cells  are  shown
    in the extra color.  It is about 10%
    slower.
 \xg  Toggle running  the  game.   Evolve/
    Stop.  Then step through generations
    until  something   exceptional  hap-
    pens, like still life or a key pres-
    sed.
 \xh  (Hide) stop  displaying  after  each
    generation.  This mode is up to  70%
    faster   than  established   by   g-
    command.
 \xl  Load (actually add) pattern  to  the
    universe from a file. This lets  you
    overlay  multiple  saved  states  to
    make for some  interesting  effects.
    Loaded pattern is  (default)  initi-
    ally considered tentative, and maybe
    manipulated in various  ways  before
    incorporating it into main  pattern.
    (To indicate  this, it's  surrounded
    by a bounding box.)  Clear the  uni-
    verse if  you  want  to  start  from
    scratch.  It is possible  either  to
    select pattern at the directory list
    directly or to  enter  pattern name.
    At the latter case it is possible to
    use wild cards.
 \xL  Immediately reload, at  the  cursor,
    a copy of the last  pattern  loaded.
    It doesn't work for ramdisk pattern.
 \xo  Forward one generation.
 \xQ  Quit.
 \xR  Change the (2-state) rules in "stays
    alive on" / "born on".  The standard
    rules are  23/3  (alive  on  two  or
    three  neighbors,  birth  on   three
    neighbors for an empty cell).
 \xS  Save the universe to a file.
 \xT  Set up the topology.  It is possible
    to use  the  rectangular  area  with
    connected edges (anchor ring,  tore)
    or the rectangular plain.
 \xv  View current pattern information.
 \xV  View comments to a file.
 \xX  Reload   palette   from   the   file
    "colors-cf".  This  file  is  loaded
    automatically at the  start  of  the
    program.
 \xZ  Set and optionally save a palette.

 Use (\rshift\g+) \rcursor keys\g and  \rHome\g  key
 to move the cursor.  Use \rspace  bar\g  to
 change the cell under cursor.

\bSTATUS BAR

\g It shows  number  of  generations,  the
 total sum of live cells,  the  slowness
 indicator (100% means the maximum slow-
 ness), the rules, and the cursor  coor-
 dinates.

\bLIMITS

\g It is possible to see only  up  to  256
 files from the disk directory. Use mask
 to show only matched files.

 The tentative pattern may show only up to
 960 cells.  This is enough to show  every
 cell from a pattern file with the size up
 to 8 blocks.

 The universe size is 160x192.

 The rules with  "born on"  condition  0
 are not supported.

 The files on ramdisk are  without  com-
 ments.

\bFORMATS

\g The first two bytes of  a pattern  file
 are width  and  height.  The  next  two
 bytes  describes "stay alive on"  cond-
 ition, and the next  two  -  "born on".
 The next contents are the sequence of X
 and Y coordinate pairs of  live  cells.
 The patterns should have USR type.

 The file with comments must have almost
 the  same  name  as  the  corresponding
 pattern filename.  The only  difference
 is the sign # at its end.  This sign is
 added to  the  pattern's  filename.  If
 this filename has  the  maximum  length
 then '#' replaces the last character of
 the pattern's filename.  The  comments'
 file is a common text  file  with  type
 SEQ.  It maybe edited by any editor.

\bUsing the 'lifeconv' utility

\g This utility  from Xlife  main  sources
 may convert CELLS,  LIF,  L,  RLE,  and
 MCL formats.  It maybe  used  from  any
 relative to Unix OS or  from  Microsoft
 Windows.  The lifeconv utility takes  a
 pattern name as an argument.  It writes
 a file to standard output that contains
 an equivalent version of the pattern in
 a different format.  Usage is:

\p   lifeconv pattern -4 >destination

\g where destination  is  any  valid  file
 name.  The '-4' option sets the  format
 for 8-bit  Xlife  for  the  destination
 file is written.  At Microsoft  Windows
 environment (Mingw Xlife port) the sign
 \p>\g must be omitted.

\bRAMDISK

\g It contains 10 patterns:

\pglider\g  the smallest, most  common,  and
        first-discovered  spaceship.  It
        travels diagonally at a speed of
        c/4.

\psmall fish\g the lightweight spaceship (or
        LWSS) is the  smallest  orthogo-
        nally moving spaceship, and  the
        second  most  common  spaceship.
        Random soups will emit one  LWSS
        for approximately every 615 gli-
        ders.  It moves at c/2  and  has
        period 4.

\pHWSS\g    the heavyweight spaceship is the
        fourth most  common  ship.

\pr-pentomino\g a methuselah that was  found
        by John Conway in 1970. It is by
        far the  most  active  polyomino
        with fewer than six  cells;  all
        of the others  stabilize  in  at
        most 10 generations, but the  R-
        pentomino does not do  so  until
        generation 1103, by  which  time
        it has a population of 116.  The
        glider it releases in generation
        69, was the  first  glider  ever
        observed.

\pbunnies\g, \plidka\g, \pacorn\g
        methuselahs with  17332,  29055,
        5206 generations lifespan.

\ptoad\g    a period 2 oscillator.

\pbi-gun\g  a double-barreled glider  gun, a
        glider  generator.  It  produces
        two gliders for 46 generations.

\pblock-laying switch engine\g      a puffer
        train which  travels  diagonally
        at c/12 towards the  upper  left
        with a period of 96. This is the
        smallest  known   object   which
        grows without bound. It produces
        eight new blocks every 288 gene-
        rations.

\bEXPLORATION

\g Here are some 2-state rules to  experi-
 ment with:

  \p23/3\g        the default, of course;
              Conway's "Life" rules.

  \p1234/3\g      patterns "crystallize"

  \p12345/45\g    patterns become contained

  \p12345/4\g     same as above, but
              settles VERY quickly

  \p5/12\g        floor  tile patterns...
              Variations of this tend
              to be interesting as well

  \p1357/1357\g   replicators world...

  \p/2\g          seeds - most patterns  ex-
              pand  indefinitely,   some
              interesting   ones.   Fast
              gliders.

  \p012345678/3\g life without  death.  Lad-
              ders.

\bFILES

  \pcolors-cf\g   this program file contains
              palette.    It's  actually
              binary  sequential   data-
              file.  Maybe omitted.

  \p(c)\g         the sequential file   with
              copyright  and  historical
              information. Should not be
              omitted!
