This program was developed under Linux.  Cygwin for Microsoft Windows provides
similar environment.  The script `compile' makes all necessary steps to build
all files of Xlife distribution.

The compilation requires presence of `tmpx' cross assembler -
http://turbo.style64.org/.  It is theoretically possible to compile sources
under Commodore 64 or Plus/4 with Turbo Assembler Macro.

The script `compile' also converts several ASCII texts to PETSCII texts.  This
requires presence of several special utilities:
   1) awk, sed, tr, rm - standard utilities for any Unix relative OS;
   2) txt2seq - a converter of ASCII texts to S00 format -

It also compresses the executables by p4compress (a part of plus4emu) -
