This program was developed under Linux.  Cygwin for Microsoft Windows provides
similar environment.  The script `compile' makes all necessary steps to build
all files of Xlife distribution.  The script `compressall' makes the optional
compression of several executable prg-files.

The table files are generated during the compilation by C-programs which
require the presence of the C-compiler (gcc or almost any other).

The compilation requires presence of `tmpx' cross assembler -
http://turbo.style64.org/.  It is theoretically possible to compile sources
under Commodore 64 or Plus/4 with Turbo Assembler Macro.

The script `compile' also converts several ASCII texts to PETSCII texts.  This
requires the presence of several special utilities:
   1) awk, sed, tr, rm - standard utilities for any Unix relative OS;
   2) txt2seq - a converter of ASCII texts to S00 format -

The script `compile' also converts Basic programs from ASCII texts to C+4
prg-format.  This requires the presence of `petcat' utility from VICE
emulator distribution.

There is one special case.  The text editor `Notepad+4' is much better after the
compilation.  So it should be made by the real or emulated C+4.  The recommended
compiler is AustroSpeed.

The optional compression is made by `p4compress' (a part of plus4emu emulator) -
